    "We see there are 27 relevant outcomes, of which 13 are green. So 13/27 really does seem to be the right answer. This picture also gives us a way to think about why the answer is not 1/3. Think of the yellow-plus-green area as a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe, with an overlap. Each stripe is half yellow and half green, so if there were no overlap at all, the probability of green would be 1/2.  When each stripe takes up half the sample space and the overlap is maximal, the probability is 1/3. And in the Problem 3 table, where the overlap is small, the probability is close to 1/2 (but slightly smaller).\n",

    "One way to look at it is that if I tell you very specific information (such as a boy born on Tuesday), it is unlikely that this applies to both children, so we have smaller overlap and a probability closer to 1/2, but if I give you broad information (a boy), this is more likely to apply to either child, resulting in a larger overlap, and a probability closer to 1/3.\n",

First, if you want to convince me, show me a sample space; don't just make philosophical arguments. (Although a philosophical argument can be employed to help you define the right sample space.) Second, while I agree that before she goes to sleep, Beauty's *unconditional* probability for heads should be 1/2, I would say that both before she goes to sleep and when she is awakened, her *conditional* probability of heads *given that she is being interviewed* should be 1/3, as shown by the sample space."

    "\n",
    "> A casino offers a game of chance for a single player in which a fair coin is tossed at each stage. The pot starts at 2 dollars and is doubled every time a head appears. The first time a tail appears, the game ends and the player wins whatever is in the pot. Thus the player wins 2 dollars if a tail appears on the first toss, 4 dollars if a head appears on the first toss and a tail on the second, etc. What is the expected value of this game to the player?\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the expected value, we see there is a 1/2 chance of a tail on the first toss (yielding a pot of \\$2) and if not that, a 1/2 &times; 1/2 = 1/4 chance of a tail on the second toss (yielding a pot of \\$4), and so on. So in total, the expected value is:\n",

    "\n",
    "The first major response to the paradox is that the casino's resources are limited. Once you break their bank, they can't pay out any more, and thus the expected return is finite. Let's model that by creating a probability distribution for the problem with a limited bank. We keep doubling the pot and halving the probability of winning the amount in the pot (half because you get the pot on a tail but not a head), until we reach the limit:"

But if I already had a million dollars and I won \\$1000, it would make less difference to me; the \\$1000 would be less valuable.  \n",

After that point, each additional dollar is worth half as much (only brings half as much happiness). Value keeps accumulating at this rate until we reach the next threshold of \"enough,\" when the utility of additional dollars is halfed again. The exact details of `util` are not critical; what matters is that overall money becomes less valuable after we have won a lot of it."

    "What can we see from this?  Eight of the 10 repetitions have a final average payoff between 10 and 35. So a price around \\$13 still seems reasonable. One outlier has an average payoff just over 100 and another just over 60, so if you are feeling lucky you might be willing to pay some amount between \\$13 and \\$30.\n",

    "We've seen how to manage probability paradoxes.  Just be explicit about what the problem says, and then methodical about defining the sample space, and finally be careful in counting the number of outcomes in the numerator and denominator. Easy as 1-2-3. But the bigger lesson is: treat those around you as reasonable people, and when they have different opinons, try to discover what problem they are  solving."
